                <p>
                    My name is Violet. I'm a 13yo programmer who is too ambitious for my own good.
                    I plan on becoming a game developer in the near future, but for now all I really have to show
                    is some really, really mediocre JQuery/Javascript, CSS, and HTML. :3

                    <br><br>

                    I spend most of my time playing crappy games and doing other things that a child would do because I
                    am
                    one. I'm a very sensitive nutcase and constructive criticism is my second biggest fear! (If you have
                    any
                    reccomendations for this section please contact me I think its kinda underdeveloped.)

                    <br><br>

                    I hope that my website doesn't suck, and if you encounter anything particularly note worthy or just
                    have
                    some nice
                    tips/advice or want me to change something, you can always find me on Github OR go to "My Socials"
                    above
                    for other
                    platforms I reside on. (I am most active on Discord and Matrix)

                        <h1>General:</h1>
                        <p>Slay the Spire is a 2d rogue-like card game that revolves around building your deck to
                            synergize together into a powerful, deadly build. Each turn you (by default) get 3 mana, and
                            each card <em>may or may not</em> use mana. Elite enemies can be encountered, providing more
                            powerful relics but more challenging enemies. Campsites provide options of Resting, to
                            replenish a % of your max health, Smithing, to upgrade a card, and a few more, obtainable
                            for the true ending and some relics.</p>
                        <h1 style="color: limegreen;">The Good:</h1>
                        <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">No matter your luck, Slay the Spire is almost completely
                            skill based. Once in a blue moon will "bad luck" truly make a difference. Despite this, the
                            game is still different enough every run for it not to get dull. <br> The game's community
                            and the developers are extremely supportive of mods, on the Steam version you can download
                            mods directly from the workshop, and play with them by selecting the Modded option on
                            startup. Furthermore, a massive Slay the Spire expansion, was turned into an accessible DLC
                            on Steam called "Slay the Spire: Downfall"</p>

                            dominate any enemy, while still keeping in mind the elemental advantages and disadvantages

                            same. The 3 dungeons are based around 3 different element, being able to choose from: <br>

                        <p>Risk of rain 2 is best described as shoot enemy get money buy chest get item shoot more enemy
                            etc... The game progressively gets more insane as you collect more items. You have to
                            remember to watch the clock though, because for every second you spend on a stage, the
                            difficulty increases. You can get to stage 6, and kill the final boss, you can get to stage
                            8, and obliterate, you can fight the new secret DLC boss by going to the void fields
                            <em>or</em> get the portal by chance <em>or</em> use it after the final boss. If you want to
                            though, you may also keep looping, going back to stage 1 again, except keeping all of your
                            items, keep the difficulty, and keep the stage count. <br>The game has a legendary sound
                            track by "Chris Christodoulou" that fits the game very well with its almost "alien" style.
                            (I have 800 hours in this game please buy it!)</p>
                        <p>Plus, the modding community is thriving and most of the mods are fantastic! (Major credit

                        <p style="color: pink;">The game often inconviniences the player for certain stupid reasons. For
                            example, the character "Captain" is unable to use certain moves in certain areas because it
                            doesnt "line up with the lore" (which is really stupid please stop making your games worse
                            for "story reasons" <br> The game locks lots of items and skills behind achievements, which
                            can often be annoying and pointless.</p>

                        <p>The game has some serious optimization issues. The game will often lag and stutter on later
                            stages. The title screen for me and many people I know tends to use an extremely unnessacary
                            amount of GPU. Furthermore for those using less powerful CPUs, the options tend to not have
                            any notable effects.</p>

                            anvils in boxes, to throwable bannanas, to a rip off of the BFG. The objective of the game

                            old and every run is veery far from eachother. No 2 runs are <em>ever</em> the same. The
                            game also has synergies, changing up the weapons and the items, and providing overpowered
                            buffs. The co-op, as well, has synergies, and is very nice.</p>

                        <p style="color: pink;">The game is kinda BS. What a big surprise for the rogue-like genre, but
                            it kinda ends up being annoying. Although this game does require its fair share of skill,
                            majority of your runs will end if you end up getting the water gun, and someone with no
                            skill could easily win with the makeshift cannon.</p>

                        <p>The modding community, although not inactive, most of the mods are not that special. Most
                            mods for the game don't provide mass amounts of content, and generally there aren't many
                            balanced based mods. Majority of mods are character mods, in which they took a random
                            character like Hunter, slapped on some new sparkly stats, and gave them a new starting
                            weapon.</p>
