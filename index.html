            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Violet. I'm a 13yo programmer who is too ambitious for my own good.
                I plan on becoming a game developer in the near future, but for now all I really have to show
                is some really, really mediocre JQuery/Javascript, CSS, and HTML. :3
                
                <br><br>

                I spend most of my time playing shitty games and doing other things that a child would do because I am
                one. I'm a very sensitive nutcase and constructive criticism is my second biggest fear! (If you have any
                reccomendations for this section please contact me I think its kinda underdeveloped.)

                <br><br>

                I hope that my website doesn't suck, and if you encounter anything particularly note worthy or just have
                some nice
                tips/advice or want me to change something, you can always find me on Github OR go to "My Socials" above
                for other
                platforms I reside on. (I am most active on Discord and Matrix)

                    <h1>General:</h1>
                    <p>Slay the Spire is a 2d rogue-like card game that revolves around building your deck to synergize together into a powerful, deadly build. Each turn you (by default) get 3 mana, and each card <em>may or may not</em> use mana. Elite enemies can be encountered, providing more powerful relics but more challenging enemies. Campsites provide options of Resting, to replenish a % of your max health, Smithing, to upgrade a card, and a few more, obtainable for the true ending and some relics.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: limegreen;">The Good:</h1>
                    <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">No matter your luck, Slay the Spire is almost completely skill based. Once in a blue moon will "bad luck" truly make a difference. Despite this, the game is still different enough every run for it not to get dull. <br> The game's community and the  developers are extremely supportive of mods, on the Steam version you can download mods directly from the workshop, and play with them by selecting the Modded option on startup. Furthermore, a massive Slay the Spire expansion, was turned into an accessible DLC on Steam called "Slay the Spire: Downfall"</p>

                    <h1><hr>General:</h1>
                    <p>Wizard Of Legend is an extremely fast-paced high energy top down FANTASTIC Rogue-like. The game revolves around building your skills or "arcana" to create a powerful set that can dominate any enemy, while still keeping in mind the elemental advantages and disadvantages of every aracana</p>
                    <h1 style="color: limegreen;"><hr>The Good:</h1>
                    <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">Wizard Of Legend keeps the runs different but not too different, each stage is procedurally generated to keep the game special without being completely random. Every run, it generates 3 Dungeons, and 1 final boss that is always the same. The 3 dungeons are based around 3 different element, being able to choose from: <br>
                        <em style="color: red;">Fire,</em>
                        <em style="color: yellow;">Lightning,</em>
                        <em style="color: lightblue;">Water,</em>
                        <em style="color: white;">Air,</em> and
                        <em style="color: brown;">Earth</em>
                    </p>
                    <h1 style="color: red;"><hr>The bad:</h1>
                    <p style="color: pink;">Certain enemies and bosses (alone or together) can get you stuck in a combo, taking immense amounts of damage with almost no way to prevent other than "1ma0 ju$t d0dg6 m8 XDDDD" (or that one item that prevents you from getting hit multiple times in a row)</p>
                    <h1 style="color: brown;"><hr>The Ugly:</h1>
                    <p>The game is a little <em>too</em> good... makes it unfair for all the other rogue likes to compete!</p>

                    <h1><hr>General:</h1>
                    <p>Risk of rain 2 is best described as shoot enemy get money buy chest get item shoot more enemy etc... The game progressively gets more insane as you collect more items. You have to remember to watch the clock though, because for every second you spend on a stage, the difficulty increases. You can get to stage 6, and kill the final boss, you can get to stage 8, and obliterate, you can fight the new secret DLC boss by going to the void fields <em>or</em> get the portal by chance <em>or</em> use it after the final boss. If you want to though, you may also keep looping, going back to stage 1 again, except keeping all of your items, keep the difficulty, and keep the stage count. <br>The game has a legendary sound track by "Chris Christodoulou" that fits the game very well with its almost "alien" style. (I have 800 hours in this game please buy it!)</p>
                    <p>Plus, the modding community is thriving and most of the mods are fantastic! (Major credit towards the StarStorm 2 team!</p>
                    <h1 style="color: limegreen;"><hr>The Good:</h1>
                    <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">The game almost never restricts the player, leading to insane runs. <br> The game has an amazing cartoony-blend for its visual style <br> The game always has new, cool ideas and every update is something special.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: red;"><hr>The bad:</h1>
                    <p style="color: pink;">The game often inconviniences the player for certain stupid reasons. For example, the character "Captain" is unable to use certain moves in certain areas because it doesnt "line up with the lore" (which is really stupid please stop making your games worse for "story reasons" <br> The game locks lots of items and skills behind achievements, which can often be annoying and pointless.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: brown;"><hr>The Ugly:</h1>
                    <p>The game has some serious optimization issues. The game will often lag and stutter on later stages. The title screen for me and many people I know tends to use an extremely unnessacary amount of GPU. Furthermore for those using less powerful CPUs, the options tend to not have any notable effects.</p>

                    <h1><hr>General:</h1>
                    <p>Enter the Gungeon is a topdown bullet hell that throws you into a dungeon with 5 main floors that can be accessed by going through an elevator. <br>The Gungeon contains many guns, from anvils in boxes, to throwable bannanas, to a rip off of the BFG. The objective of the game is to escape, or destroy, the Gungeon.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: limegreen;"><hr>The Good:</h1>
                    <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">The game has a wide variety of items and weapons that all have their unique properties setting them apart from others. The gameplay loop rarely gets old and every run is veery far from eachother. No 2 runs are <em>ever</em> the same. The game also has synergies, changing up the weapons and the items, and providing overpowered buffs. The co-op, as well, has synergies, and is very nice.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: red;"><hr>The bad:</h1>
                    <p style="color: pink;">The game is kinda BS. What a big surprise for the rogue-like genre, but it kinda ends up being annoying. Although this game does require its fair share of skill, majority of your runs will end if you end up getting the water gun, and someone with no skill could easily win with the makeshift cannon.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: brown;"><hr>The Ugly:</h1>
                    <p>The modding community, although not inactive, most of the mods are not that special. Most mods for the game don't provide mass amounts of content, and generally there aren't many balanced based mods. Majority of mods are character mods, in which they took a random character like Hunter, slapped on some new sparkly stats, and gave them a new starting weapon.</p>
